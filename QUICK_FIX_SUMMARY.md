# 🚀 Quick Fix Summary - Backend Flooding Issue

## ⚡ What Was Fixed

Your React app was flooding the backend with **dozens of requests per second**. Here's what I fixed:

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1️⃣ **WineCategoriesDisplay.tsx**
**Problem:** Two `useEffect` hooks fetching the same data = **2× API calls**

**Fix:**
- ❌ Removed duplicate `useEffect` (lines 210-228)
- ✅ Consolidated into single data fetch on mount
- ✅ Used `useRef` to prevent polling callback from recreating

**Before:** 2 fetches on mount + burst fetches on state changes  
**After:** 1 fetch on mount + stable polling every 30s

---

### 2️⃣ **EventCreatedPage.tsx**
**Problem:** Massive useEffect with stale closures causing **interval leaks**

**Fix:**
- ❌ Removed complex visibilitychange handler with stale closures
- ✅ Split into 2 clean useEffects: (1) initial load, (2) polling
- ✅ Used refs to prevent stale closures
- ✅ Used functional `setState` to access latest state

**Before:** Multiple stacked intervals + stale closures  
**After:** Single clean interval with proper cleanup

---

### 3️⃣ **useSmartPolling.ts**
**Problem:** Immediately executed callback on **every restart** = burst requests

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added `immediate` parameter to `startPolling()`
- ✅ Only executes immediately on **initial mount**
- ✅ Subsequent restarts wait for the interval

**Before:** Burst requests every time callback changed  
**After:** Smooth, predictable polling

## 📊 Impact

### Request Frequency
```
BEFORE:  ████████████████████████████ (dozens per second)
AFTER:   █ (1 on mount) ... █ (every 30s) ... █ (every 30s)
```

### Components Fixed
- ✅ `WineCategoriesDisplay.tsx`
- ✅ `EventCreatedPage.tsx`
- ✅ `useSmartPolling.ts` hook
- ✅ `AverageScore.tsx` (already good, no changes needed)

---

## ✅ Best Practices Now Followed

1. ✅ **Data loads once** when component mounts
2. ✅ **Polling is throttled** to 30 seconds
3. ✅ **Proper cleanup** on unmount
4. ✅ **Stable dependencies** (using refs where needed)
5. ✅ **No duplicate fetches**
6. ✅ **No stale closures**

---

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Open **Chrome DevTools → Network tab**
2. Load your app
3. Watch the requests:
   - Should see **1 request on mount**
   - Then **1 request every 30 seconds**
   - **No bursts** when clicking around
